# Visualizing the Scripts of Data Wrangling with SOMNUS

This repository contains the supplemental material for "Visualizing the Scripts of Data Wrangling with SOMNUS".



## Content

- glyphs : An entire glyph collection for 23 data transformations.
- user study : Scripts, data tables, questions, quantitative results, etc. for the user study.
- video: A video showing the usages of two application systems of Somnus in different scenarios. (Due to the network access control, the direct connection to <https://somnus.zjvis.net> and <https://somnus.zjvis.net/#/morpheus> has been restricted temporarily. So we recorded the video.)
